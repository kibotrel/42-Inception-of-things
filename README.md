# 42-Inception-of-things

This is an introductory project that teaches how to use an orchestration tool called [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to better understand how to scale and manage a cluster of servers. It is part of the [42 Paris](https://www.42.fr/) program.

Using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), we'll create virtual environments with different configurations to tinker with Kubernetes.
